Variables are used to store data values. Use the equals sign to assign a value to a variable. Once a variable has been created it can be used in calculations. You can display the value of a variable using `print()`.

```python
coins = 10
coins = coins + 5
print(coins)
```
*Output:*
```python
15
```

## Exercises

Experiment with variables:

1. Create variables `length` and `width` and assign them numerical values. Calculate and print the area of a rectangle using the formula: area equals length times width.

2. Create two variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them integer values. Calculate and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

3. Create a variable `fahrenheit` and assign it a temperature in Fahrenheit. Convert the temperature to Celsius using the formula: **C=(F-32) times (5/9)**

   *Hint: use tab completion when typing out* `fahrenheit`
