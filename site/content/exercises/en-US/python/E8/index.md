Variables can store data of different types - so far we have discussed numbers (integers and floats), strings, lists, and bools. You can determine the type of a variable using `type()`:


```python
type(45)
```
*Output:*
```python
int
```

Here's the string type:
```python
type("Hello")
```
*Output:*
```python
str
```

The list type:
```python
type([2, 5, 7, 10])
```
*Output:*
```python
list
```

The boolean type:
```python
type(True)
```
*Output:*
```python
bool
```

## Exercises

What is `type('45')` and why is this different from the first example above?
